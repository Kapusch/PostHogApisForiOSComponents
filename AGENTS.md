# Public native SDK working agreement

Produce a reproducible `Kapusch.PostHog.iOS` NuGet. Keep all documentation,
samples and artifacts generic. No application/company names, real project keys,
private diagnostics or customer data. Follow src/Native, buildTransitive, Docs
and samples conventions. Package native dependencies; consumer builds never
fetch them. No custom event queue: use the upstream SDK's persistence and retries.
Pin versions and dependency integrity, include third-party licenses. Verify a
clean packed-package consumer and device/runtime semantics before claiming support.

## Branches and releases

- `main` is the only long-lived branch and the source of every NuGet.org release.
- Implement changes on short-lived branches and target `main` through a PR.
- Stable (`vX.Y.Z`) and prerelease (`vX.Y.Z-rc.N`) tags must reference commits reachable from `origin/main`.
- Manual runs without a version publish previews to GitHub Packages. See `Docs/Release.md` for the complete contract.
